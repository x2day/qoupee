_Imagine looking for a cream for dry skin while avoiding oranges. Normally, you'd ask a consultant for help. Meet our AI Assistant - Coupee, that offers personalized recommendations and can chat with you in your preferred language, making your search easy and tailored to your needs._

## Data collection
We’ve set up a database with products in three categories: Facial Cleansing Washes, Single Board Computers, and Nightstands, all available on qoupee.x2day.org (our Mock website). Each product entry includes the name, price, and images, with detailed URLs linked for easy browsing.


## Testing environment 
Using our collected data, we’ve built a WordPress website to test our assistant. We exported a .csv file of product links from our website and imported it into MandoDB for seamless integration and testing.
